                        <p>Kristin founded Forging Friends in 2013 and currently serves as Chief Executive Officer, overseeing all aspects of the organization.

For more than 15 years, prior to establishing Forging Friendships, Kristin worked within the high tech industry of Silicon Valley as a software sales executive at Oracle, PeopleSoft and Kewill ERP. She rose through each organization successively, eventually taking on greater responsibilities to become a top revenue performer while building and maintaining well established long term partner relationships with many key executives. Kristin brings business acumen as well as a genuine desire to solve a need with this unique nonprofit. 

Kristin is the mother of three boys.  CJ is thirteen; Joshua is ten and her youngest, Zac is nine years old.  Zac is Kristin’s special needs child; he has Cerebral Palsy and is wheelchair dependent.  


Thought the years, Kristin has found that unlike her traditional children, Zac struggles to find meaningful friendships outside of school.  As a mother in a unique situation, she hasn’t had the opportunity to make connections with other parents who face similar challenges. 

She created Forging Friendships to fill the void of social isolation that special needs children and their parents often face.  

Her vision is an uplifting environment where special needs children can forge friendships with traditional children and where the parents can also make positive connections with other caregivers in similar situations.
