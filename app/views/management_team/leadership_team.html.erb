<h1>Leadership Team</h1>

<h2>Kristin Spanier </h2>
<h3>Founder </h3>
<p>Kristin founded Forging Friends in 2013 and currently serves as Chief Executive Officer, overseeing all aspects of the organization.</p>  

<p>For more than 15 years, prior to establishing Forging Friendships, Kristin worked within the high tech industry of Silicon Valley as a software sales executive at Oracle, PeopleSoft and Kewill ERP. She rose through each organization successively, eventually taking on greater responsibilities to become a top revenue performer while building and maintaining well established long term partner relationships with many key executives. Kristin brings business acumen as well as a genuine desire to solve a need with this unique nonprofit. 
</p>
<p>Kristin is the mother of three boys.  CJ is thirteen; Joshua is ten and her youngest, Zac is nine years old.  Zac is Kristin’s special needs child; he has Cerebral Palsy and is wheelchair dependent.  
</p>
<p>Through the years, Kristin has found that unlike her traditional children, Zac struggles to find meaningful friendships outside of school.  As a mother in a unique situation, she hasn’t had the opportunity to make connections with other parents who face similar challenges. </p>
<p>She created Forging Friendships to fill the void of social isolation that special needs children and their parents often face.   </p>
<p>Her vision is an uplifting environment where special needs children can forge friendships with traditional children and where the parents can also make positive connections with other caregivers in similar situations. </p>
<h2>Courtney Moran </h2>
<h3> Co-Founder and Chief Marketing Officer </h3>
<p>Courtney is a strategic thinker and subject matter expert in the field of marketing, she has lead various marketing initiatives and was the Executive Director of Marketing for Essential.com, a high-tech startup firm in Massachusetts. At this position Courtney was responsible for the corporate vision of Essential’s brand as it expanded and matured into new markets.  She spearheaded the implementation of all marketing activities across all aspects of the marketing mix. 
 </p>
<p>Courtney left the corporate world to raise her twins, Jake and Abby, who are now eleven years old. Both of her children will be part Forging Friendship’s Empathy in Action program, as traditional children are an essential part of the volunteer team.</p>

<p>Courtney grew up watching her mother volunteer for various nonprofits, which eventually developed into a full-time position this included leading various nonprofit fundraising efforts, raising community awareness as well as establishing and maintaining relationships with individual donors at all levels. This positive exposure never left Courtney.</p>
<p>Today Courtney is following in the example set by her mother; she is excited to use her corporate skill set and contribute, as her mother lovingly did, to those in need.</p>
